        "\n",
        "1. What is a RESTful API\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions that allow communication between different software\n",
        "   applications. It enables systems to interact with each other over the internet by providing a standardized way of exchanging data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of API specification\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> API specification in Python refers to a detailed, technical description of an API's behavior, including its available endpoints, request/response formats, and data\n",
        "   models. It acts as a blueprint for both developers building the API and those intending to use it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Flask is a lightweight, micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to be simple and flexible, providing the essential tools for building web applications\n",
        "   and APIs without unnecessary complexity. Flask is often chosen for creating RESTful APIs due to its straightforward nature and the control it gives developers over\n",
        "   the application's structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is routing in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Routing in Flask is the mechanism that maps specific URLs to Python functions. It's a core concept that allows you to define how your web application responds to\n",
        "   different client requests. When a user enters a URL in their browser, Flask's routing system determines which function should be executed to handle that request.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do you create a simple Flask application\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Here's how to create a basic Flask application in Python:\n",
        "   1. Install Flask: Open your terminal or command prompt and Run the following command.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Code\n",
        "\n",
        "     pip install flask\n",
        "   2. Create a Python File:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Create a new file named app.py (or any name you prefer).\n",
        "   3. Write the Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Open app.py in a text editor or IDE.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Add the following code:\n",
        "     Python\n",
        "\n",
        "          from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",

        "            app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "  4. Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "    from flask import Flask: Imports the Flask class.\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__): Creates a Flask application instance.\n",

        "def hello_world():: Function that returns the text \"Hello, World!\" when the root URL is accessed.\n",
        "if __name__ == '__main__':: Checks if the script is being run directly.\n",
        "app.run(debug=True): Runs the Flask application with debugging enabled.\n",
        "  5. Run the Application:\n",
        "In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved app.py.\n",
        "Run the following command:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Code\n",
        "\n",
        "     python app.py\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Here are the commonly used HTTP methods in RESTful APIs, especially within the context of Python:\n",
        "  1. GET:\n",
        "Used to retrieve data from a specific resource.\n",
        "It should not modify data on the server.\n",
        "It is considered a safe and idempotent method, meaning multiple identical requests will produce the same result without causing side effects.\n",
        "  2. POST:\n",
        "Used to create new resources.\n",
        "Data sent in the request body is used to create the new resource.\n",
        "Not idempotent, as multiple identical requests will result in multiple resources being created.\n",
        "  3. PUT:\n",
        "Used to update or replace an existing resource.\n",
        "If the resource doesn't exist, it might create a new one.\n",
        "Idempotent, as multiple identical requests will result in the same state of the resource.\n",
        "  4. PATCH:\n",
        "Used to partially update an existing resource.\n",
        "Only the fields specified in the request body are updated.\n",
        "Not necessarily idempotent, as multiple requests might lead to different results if the updates are not idempotent.\n",
        "  5. DELETE:\n",
        "Used to remove a resource.\n",
        "Idempotent, as multiple identical requests will result in the resource being deleted (or already absent).\n",
        "\n",
        "   These HTTP methods are fundamental to RESTful API design and are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. Each method has a specific purpose and should be used according to RESTful principles for a well-structured API.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Flask, the @app.route() decorator serves as a crucial mechanism for routing incoming HTTP requests to specific functions within your application. It essentially\n",
        "   maps a URL to a Python function, enabling Flask to determine which function should handle a particular request.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> GET and POST are two of the most common HTTP methods used for communication between clients and servers. They have distinct characteristics and are used for different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  GET\n",
        "\n",
        "  Purpose: Primarily used to retrieve data from a server.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Data Transmission: Sends data as part of the URL, in the query string.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Visibility: Data is visible in the URL, making it less secure for sensitive information.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Data Length: Limited by URL length restrictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Caching: GET requests can be cached by browsers and proxies.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Idempotency: GET requests are considered idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Use Case: Suitable for requesting web pages, images, or other resources where no server-side modification is needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  POST\n",
        "\n",
        "  Purpose: Used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Data Transmission: Sends data in the request body.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Visibility: Data is not visible in the URL, making it more secure for sensitive information.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Data Length: No restriction on data size.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Caching: POST requests are not cached by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Idempotency: POST requests are not considered idempotent, as sending the same request multiple times may have different results.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Use Case: Suitable for submitting forms, uploading files, or any operation that modifies server-side data.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Error handling in Flask APIs is essential for creating robust and user-friendly applications. Here's a breakdown of how to handle errors effectively:\n",
        "  1. Built-in HTTP Exceptions:\n",
        "  \n",
        "     Flask leverages Werkzeug, which provides standard HTTP exceptions like NotFound, BadRequest, Unauthorized, etc.\n",
        "You can raise these exceptions directly using abort(status_code) from Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Python\n",
        "\n",
        "          from flask import Flask, abort\n",
        "\n",
        "          app = Flask(__name__)\n",

        "            return f\"Item ID: {item_id}\"\n",
        " 2. Custom Error Handlers:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Use the @app.errorhandler(ExceptionType) decorator to create custom error handlers for specific exception types or HTTP status codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "     These handlers allow you to return custom error responses (e.g., JSON) instead of Flask's default HTML error pages.\n",

        "\n",
        "   -> The url_for() function in Flask is used to generate URLs dynamically based on view function names, rather than hardcoding them. This approach offers several advantages:\n",

        "     Flexibility:\n",
        "\n",

        "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "   -> An API (Application Programming Interface) specification is a document that formally describes how an API works. It acts as a blueprint for the API, outlining its structure, operations, data formats, and other key details, according to Archbee and APIToolkit. This document is essential for developers building and using the API, ensuring consistency and clarity.\n",
        "   There are two ways of creating a REST API in Flask:\n",

        "     One function to just return or print the data sent through GET or POST and another function to calculate the square of a number sent through GET request and print it.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Method 2: Using flask-restful\n",
        "\n",
        "      Flask Restful is an extension for Flask that adds support for building REST APIs in Python using Flask as the back-end. It encourages best practices and is very easy to set up. Flask restful is very easy to pick up if you're already familiar with flask. In flask_restful, the main building block is a resource. Each resource can have several methods associated with it such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. for example, there could be a resource that calculates the square of a number whenever a get request is sent to it. Each resource is a class that inherits from the Resource class of flask_restful. Once the resource is created and defined, we can add our custom resource to the api and specify a URL path for that corresponding resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that a server sends to a client (like a web browser or an application) in response to a request. They indicate whether the request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action. These codes are part of the HTTP protocol and are crucial for communication between clients and servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Handling POST requests in Flask involves a few key steps. First, you need to define a route that accepts POST requests using the methods parameter in the @app.route decorator. Then, within the view function associated with that route, you can access the data sent in the request body using the request object.\n",

        "\n",
        "   -> The Flask RESTful extension significantly simplifies building RESTful APIs in Python using the Flask microframework. It provides tools and abstractions to make API development more organized, efficient, and easier to manage. Essentially, it enhances Flask with the capabilities to build robust and feature-rich RESTful APIs by handling common tasks like request parsing, response formatting, and resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Flask, the session object allows you to store user-specific data across multiple HTTP requests, making it possible to maintain state between different interactions with a web application. It's like a temporary storage area that persists data throughout a user's session.\n",
