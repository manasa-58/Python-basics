        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Python is a general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in the 1980s.\n",
        " It is incredibly versatile, flexible, and beginner-friendly; hence is 2023's most popular programming language worldwide.\n",
        " Python is the most popular yet easiest programming language to learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line.\n",
        "   It translates the high-level Python code into machine-readable bytecode and then executes it, allowing you to see the results immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Python Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in Python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The keyword cannot be used as  variable name\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Simple objects like numbers, strings, bools, and even tuples are immutable, but most other objects in Python, like lists and dicts, are mutable.\n",
        "  This means that they can be modified in place—modifying an object in one part of a program can cause it to be (unexpectedly) different in another part of the program\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified).\n",
        "   We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The '==' is known as the equality operator. The 'is' is known as the identity operator. The == operator helps us compare the equality of objects.\n",
        "   The is operator helps us check whether different variables point towards a similar object in the memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify boolean values (True or False). There are three main logical operators:\n",
        "   and: Returns True if both operands are True, otherwise it returns False.\n",
        "   or: Returns True if at least one of the operands is True, otherwise it returns False.\n",
        "   not: Returns True if the operand is False, and False if the operand is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one data type into another.\n",
        "   Ex: you want to change the data type of a variable from an integer 2 to a float 2.0. This is a case where you'd use type casting.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Implicit and explicit type casting, also known as type conversion, are mechanisms for converting a value from one data type to another.\n",
        "   Implicit type casting happens automatically by the compiler, while explicit type casting requires the programmer to define the conversion using specific syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> conditionals provide a mechanism to control the flow of execution of a program in many programming languages.\n",
        "   In Python, the if -statement will run a section of code if and only if the conditional provided is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions.\n",
        "   For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The main difference between for and while loops lies in when the number of iterations is known beforehand.\n",
        "   for loops are used when the number of iterations is known or can be easily determined at the beginning of the loop,\n",
        "   while while loops are used when the number of iterations is dependent on a dynamic condition and is not known in advance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> A while loop is particularly useful when you do not know beforehand how many times you want to repeat the execution of your code.\n",
        "   It will keep executing as long as a specified condition is true\n",
