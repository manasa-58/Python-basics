        "#1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "   \n",
        "   -> Python is often described as an interpreted language, but it's actually a hybrid, undergoing compilation before interpretation. Unlike compiled languages that\n",
        "   translate the entire program into machine code beforehand, Python's code is first compiled into bytecode and then interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\n",
        "   This means Python code is not directly executed but is first converted to an intermediate representation (bytecode) which is then interpreted line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> We use the try and except statements in Python to handle exceptions that may occur during program execution. We place statements that may raise exceptions within\n",
        "   the try block and place statements to handle exceptions in the except clause. They enable us to handle errors efficiently without crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The finally block in Python's exception handling mechanism serves to define a section of code that executes regardless of whether an exception occurs within the try\n",
        "   block. Its primary purpose is to ensure that cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources, are always performed, thus maintaining the integrity and\n",
        "   stability of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. What is logging in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Logging in Python is a built-in module that provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. It allows developers to track events, debug issues, and monitor the health of their applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method. It's automatically called when an object is about to be garbage collected, meaning it's no longer referenced and the memory it occupies can be reclaimed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Python, both import and from ... import are used to bring external code into your current program. However, they differ in how they make the imported elements\n",
        "   available:\n",
        "\n",
        "   import module_name:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Imports the entire module.\n",
        "   You access the module's contents using dot notation (module_name.element).\n",
        "   This approach avoids naming conflicts, as each module's elements are kept within its namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "   from module_name import element1, element2, ...\n",
        "\n",
        "   Imports specific elements (functions, classes, variables) from a module directly into the current namespace.\n",
        "   You can use the imported elements directly without needing to prefix them with the module name.\n",
        "   While convenient, this can lead to naming conflicts if multiple modules have elements with the same name.\n",
        "   It can also make it less clear where an element originates from.\n",
        "\n",
        "#7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Python allows you to catch multiple exceptions in a single try-except block by using a tuple of exception types. For example: except (TypeError, ValueError): This will handle either a TypeError or a ValueError in the same block.\n",
        "\n",
        "#8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The with statement in Python is primarily used for resource management, particularly when dealing with files. It ensures that resources, such as files, are properly\n",
        "   opened, used, and then automatically closed, regardless of whether an error occurs during the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "#9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Multithreading refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently, where each thread runs a process. Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel, where each processor can run one or more threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "#10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Logging is essential to understand the behaviour of the application and to debug unexpected issues or for simply tracking events. In the production environment, we can't debug issues without proper log files as they become the only source of information to debug some intermittent or unexpected errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "#11. What is memory management in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Memory management in Python is the process of allocating and deallocating memory for objects. Python uses a private heap to store all the objects and data structures. The Python memory manager takes care of allocating memory for new objects and freeing up memory for objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "#12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Python, exceptions are caught and handled using the 'try' and 'except' block. 'try' contains the code segment which is susceptible to error, while 'except' is where the program should jump in case an exception occurs. You can use multiple 'except' blocks for handling different types of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#13. Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating a computer's main memory. It ensures that blocks of memory space are properly managed and allocated so the operating system (OS), applications and other running processes have the memory they need to carry out their operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In exception handling, try and except blocks work together to gracefully handle errors that might occur during program execution. The try block contains code that might potentially raise an exception, while the except block contains the code that executes if an exception occurs within the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "#15. How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Python uses a hybrid garbage collection system consisting of reference counting and generational garbage collection. This system automatically manages memory, freeing up space occupied by objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "#16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In exception handling, the else block is executed only if no exceptions are raised within the try block. It allows you to execute code that should run when the try block completes successfully, separating it from the exception handling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#17. What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "\n",
        " -> Here are the common logging levels in Python, which are part of the built-in logging module:\n",
        "1. DEBUG (Numeric Value: 10)\n",
        "Used for detailed information, primarily useful for diagnosing issues and debugging.\n",
        "The least threatening level.\n",
        "2. INFO (Numeric Value: 20)\n",
        "Provides general information about the program's operation, confirming that things are working as expected.\n",
        "Not very threatening.\n",
        "3. WARNING (Numeric Value: 30)\n",
        "Indicates that something unexpected has occurred or that a potential problem might arise.\n",
        "Needs attention.\n",
        "4. ERROR (Numeric Value: 40)\n",
        "Signifies a more serious problem where the software has not been able to perform a function.\n",
        "Needs immediate attention.\n",
        "5. CRITICAL (Numeric Value: 50)\n",
        "A severe error that indicates the program may be unable to continue running.\n",
        "Means \"drop everything and find out what's wrong.\"\n",
        "6. NOTSET (Numeric Value: 0)\n",
        "The initial default setting of a log.\n",
        "When set, the logger will inherit the logging level of its parent.\n",
        "These levels are arranged in increasing order of severity. When you set a logging level, only messages of that level or higher will be logged. For example, if you set the level to WARNING, only WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL messages will be recorded.\n",
        "\n",
        "#18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The os.fork() system call and the multiprocessing module in Python both enable the creation of new processes, but they differ significantly in their approach and capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "os.fork()\n",
        "\n",
        "Creates a new process by duplicating the existing one, including its memory space and file descriptors.\n",
        "It's a low-level system call, primarily available on Unix-like systems.\n",
        "It's very fast because it avoids the overhead of starting a new Python interpreter.\n",
        "It can be problematic in multithreaded programs due to potential deadlocks or inconsistent states.\n",
        "It requires careful handling of shared resources to avoid conflicts between parent and child processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Provides a high-level interface for managing processes, offering features like process pools, queues, and locks.\n",
        "It's cross-platform, working on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
        "It can use different start methods, including \"fork\" (similar to os.fork()), \"spawn\" (starts a new Python interpreter), and \"forkserver\" (starts a server process for creating new processes).\n",
        "It handles inter-process communication (IPC) more robustly, preventing issues like resource contention and deadlocks.\n",
        "It's generally slower than os.fork() due to the overhead of process creation and management.\n",
        "\n",
        "#19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> When a file is open, the operating system allocates memory and other resources to the file, which can potentially impact the performance of the system if too many files are open at the same time. By closing the file, you release these resources back to the system, which can be used by other processes or programs.\n",
        "   \n",
        "#20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The `read()` method can be used to read binary data or text from a file, while the `readline()` method is typically used for reading lines of text.  When using\n",
        "   `read()`, you need to specify the number of characters you want to read, while `readline()` automatically reads until a newline character is encountered.\n",
        "\n",
        "#21. What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The logging module in Python is a versatile tool used to track events and record information during program execution. It allows developers to identify errors, debug issues, and monitor the health of their applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "#22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "#23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Memory management problems. The basic problem in managing memory is knowing when to keep the data it contains, and when to throw it away so that the memory can be reused. This sounds easy, but is, in fact, such a hard problem that it is an entire field of study in its own right.\n",
        "\n",
        "#24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> To manually raise an exception in Python, use the raise statement. Here is an example of how to use it: Copied! In this example, the calculate_payment function raises a ValueError exception if the payment_type is not either \"Visa\" or \"Mastercard\".\n",
        "\n",
        "#25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Multithreading is important in applications that benefit from concurrency, such as those involving I/O-bound tasks, real-time data processing, or where multiple tasks can run independently without blocking each other. By using multiple threads, applications can improve performance, responsiveness, and scalability.\n",
