        "\n",
        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important\n",
        "  \n",
        "   -> A data structure is a way to organize and store data in a computer so it\n",
        "     can be used efficiently.\n",
        "     It's crucial for efficient data management, program performance, and problem-solving in computer science.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In programming, mutable data types can be changed after they are created,\n",
        "      while immutable data types cannot be modified once initialized.\n",
        "      Examples of mutable types include lists and dictionaries, while immutable types include strings and tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.\n",
        "\n",
        "           Lists                                               tuples\n",
        "      \n",
        "       Lists are mutable(can be modified).\t                    Tuples are immutable(cannot be modified).\n",
        "\t     Iteration over lists is time-consuming.\t                Iterations over tuple is faster\n",
        "\n",
        "       Lists are better for performing operations,\n",
        "        such as insertion and deletion.\t                        Tuples are more suitable for accessing elements efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Lists consume more memory.\t                            Tuples consumes less memory\n",
        "\t    Lists have several built-in methods.\t                  Tuples have fewer built-in methods.\n",
        "\t     Lists are more prone to unexpected changes and errors.\tTuples, being immutable are less error prone.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> A Python dictionary is a data structure that stores the value in key:\n",
        "      value pairs. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can't be repeated and must be immutable. Example: Here,\n",
        "      The data is stored in key:value pairs in dictionaries, which makes it easier to find values.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Because sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element,\n",
        "      it makes sets highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a list or tuple and to perform common math operations like unions and intersections.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list\n",
        "   \n",
        "   -> In Python, a string is an immutable sequence of characters, while a list\n",
        "     is a mutable sequence of items,\n",
        "     which can be of any data type. Strings are primarily used for text-based data, whereas lists can hold a variety of items and are more versatile for organizing and manipulating collections of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python\n",
        "  \n",
        "   -> Tuples in Python ensure data integrity through their immutability. Once a\n",
        "      tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed.\n",
        "      This characteristic guarantees that the data stored within a tuple remains constant throughout its lifecycle, preventing accidental or unintended changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each\n",
        "      key is unique and is associated with a specific value.\n",
        "      It uses a hash function to compute an index (or hash code) for each key, which determines the position in the table where the corresponding value is stored.\n",
        "      This allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data, typically with an average time complexity of O(1).\n",
        "      In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When a key-value pair is added to a dictionary, Python's built-in hash function calculates the hash value of the key,\n",
        "      which is then used to determine the storage location for that pair. This implementation means that dictionaries in Python offer fast lookups, insertions, and deletions, making them a powerful and versatile data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Yes, lists in Python can contain elements of different data types. This  \n",
        "      is one of the features that makes Python lists very flexible.\n",
        "      A single list can hold integers, floats, strings, booleans, and even other lists or more complex objects like dictionaries and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Strings in Python are immutable because of several key benefits related\n",
        "       to performance, safety, and ease of use.\n",
        "       Immutability ensures that once a string is created, its value remains constant throughout its lifetime. This characteristic enables various optimizations and prevents unintended side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> A list can store any data type. In contrast, keys in the dictionary can  \n",
        "      be of any immutable data type, and values can be of any data type.\n",
        "      Lists perform faster for ordered operations like sorting, while dictionaries perform faster for lookup operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> When to Use Tuples Over Lists? Tuples are immutable. Hence, they are\n",
        "      primarily used to store data that doesn't change frequently.\n",
        "      Any operation can store data in a tuple when you don't want it to change.\n",
        "      Ex: Employee details(EMP id , address...)\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Sets in Python are designed to store only unique elements. When an        attempt is made to add a duplicate value to a set, it is automatically ignored,\n",
        "     and the set remains unchanged. This behavior ensures that sets always contain distinct values, making them useful for tasks like removing duplicates from a list or checking for membership without redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The in operation for the dictionary tests on keys. The key of the\n",
        "      dictionary is a unique value as well as the set, and the execution time is about the same as for sets.\n",
        "      On the other hand, dictionary values can be duplicated like a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Tuples are immutable, so once they are created, we can't change, add, or\n",
        "      remove their elements. If we try to modify a tuple, it will throw a TypeError.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the value of one or more keys  \n",
        "      is another dictionary. It's essentially a dictionary within a dictionary, allowing for more complex data structures and organization.\n",
        "      A common use case is representing hierarchical data like an employee directory with each employee having their own dictionary of details.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Accessing an element in a dictionary using its key generally has a time complexity of O(1) on average. This means it takes a constant amount of time, regardless of the dictionary's size. Dictionaries achieve this efficiency by using a hash table as their underlying data structure,\n",
        "    where keys are hashed to determine their location.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> For quick data look-ups, configurations, or caches, favor dictionaries.\n",
        "      For ordered collections and sequence operations, such as maintaining a stack or queue, lists are more suitable.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data\n",
        "    retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> Dictionaries are unordered. When we say that dictionaries are ordered,  \n",
        "       it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.\n",
        "       Unordered means that the items do not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> A list is an ordered collection of items, whereas a dictionary is an\n",
        "      unordered data collection in a key: value pair. Elements from the list can be accessed using the index,\n",
        "      while the elements of the dictionary can be accessed using keys.\n"
