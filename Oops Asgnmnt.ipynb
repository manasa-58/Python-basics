        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   -> Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code that manipulates that data. In OOP,\n",
        "   objects are created from templates called \"classes\", which define the properties and behavior of the objects they create.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates data (attributes) and\n",
        "   functions (methods) that describe a specific type of entity. A class acts as a blueprint from which objects (instances of the class) are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental unit that represents a real-world entity or concept. It's an instance of a class, encapsulating\n",
        "   both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Objects interact with each other by sending and receiving messages, triggering methods and potentially modifying their\n",
        "   internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Abstraction in Python simplifies complex systems, hiding implementation details for better code readability. Encapsulation safeguards data integrity by restricting\n",
        "   direct access to an object's data and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__). They\n",
        "   provide a way to define how objects of a class should behave with built-in operators and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (the child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class\n",
        "   (the parent or superclass). This enables code reusability and a hierarchical organization of classes, fostering a more structured and modular design.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This\n",
        "   enables code reusability and flexibility because multiple classes can implement the same method in their own unique ways. It's a core concept that helps achieve\n",
        "   abstraction and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Encapsulation is achieved by declaring a class's data members and methods as either private or protected. But in Python, we do not have keywords like public, private,\n",
        "   and protected, as in the case of Java. Instead, we achieve this by using single and double underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Python, a constructor is a special method called when an object is created. Its purpose is to assign values to the data members within the class when an object\n",
        "   is initialized. The name of the constructor method is always __init__.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes. They have access to the class object and can modify class variables or create new instances of the class. Static methods, on the other hand, do not have access to the class object and cannot modify any class-level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods within the same class that share the same name but have different parameters. Python does not inherently support method overloading in the same way as some other languages like Java or C++. However, it achieves a similar effect through flexible argument handling using default arguments or\n",
        "   variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent\n",
        "   class (superclass). This enables the subclass to modify or extend the method's behavior, ensuring the correct method is called based on the object's type, a key\n",
        "   aspect of polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Python, a property decorator is a built-in feature that allows methods to be accessed like attributes. It provides a way to encapsulate attribute access with\n",
        "   custom logic, such as getters, setters, and deleters, without changing the way the attribute is accessed from outside the class. The @property decorator is used to\n",
        "   define the getter method, while @attribute.setter and @attribute.deleter are used for the setter and deleter methods, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility. It allows objects of different classes\n",
        "   to be treated as objects of a common type, simplifying code and making it easier to adapt to new situations.\n",
        "    \n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> An abstract class is like a template for other classes. It defines methods that must be included in any class that inherits from it, but it doesn't provide the\n",
        "   actual code for those methods. Think of it as a recipe without specific ingredients—it tells you what steps to follow, but the details depend on the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Object-oriented programming (OOP) offers numerous advantages that make it a popular choice for software development. These benefits include improved code\n",
        "   organization, reusability, and maintainability, as well as enhanced security and scalability. OOP promotes a modular and structured approach to problem-solving, making it easier to debug, modify, and extend software.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Class variables are shared by all instances (objects) of a class, while instance variables are unique to each instance. Class variables are typically used to store\n",
        "   data that is the same across all objects of that class, like a constant or shared value. Instance variables are used to store data that is specific to each individual object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This enables a class to combine\n",
        "   functionalities from different sources, creating a more versatile and reusable code structure.   \n",
        "   \n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> __str__ is used for informal string representations, such as printing objects for user consumption. __repr__ is used for formal string representations, including\n",
        "   debugging, logging, and object inspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class within a child class. It plays a crucial role in inheritance, allowing subclasses to\n",
        "   extend and modify the behavior of their superclasses while reusing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The __del__ method in Python is a powerful tool for managing resource cleanup when objects are destroyed. It allows you to define specific actions that should be\n",
        "   taken when an object is garbage collected, such as closing files, releasing locks, or closing network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The key differences between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python lie in their binding and the arguments they receive:\n",
        "     \n",
        "     @staticmethod:\n",
        "   \n",
        "   It is not bound to the class or the instance.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   It doesn't receive any implicit arguments (like self or cls).\n",
        "   \n",
        "   It behaves like a regular function defined inside a class.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   It's used for utility functions that are logically related to the class but don't need access to its attributes.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    @classmethod:\n",
        "   \n",
        "   It is bound to the class, not the instance.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   It receives the class itself as the first argument (conventionally named cls).\n",
        "   \n",
        "   It can access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   It's used for factory methods, alternative constructors, or when you need to work with class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways. When combined with\n",
        "   inheritance in Python, it allows a child class to redefine a method from its parent class, a process known as method overriding. This creates a hierarchy where\n",
        "   methods can be called generically on objects, and the correct implementation is executed based on the object's actual class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Methods chaining is a style of programming in which invoking multiple method calls occurs sequentially. It removes the pain of assigning variables at each\n",
        "   intermediate step as each call performs action on same object and then returns the object to next call.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> The __call__ method is part of Python build-in methods also called dunder or magic methods because have two prefixes and suffix underscores in the method name. The\n",
        "   main idea of __call__ method is to write a class and invoke it like a function. You can refer to it as callable object.\n",
